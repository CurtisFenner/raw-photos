> Information technology â€” Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone still images: Requirements and guidelines


> Specifies processes for converting source image data to compressed image data,
> processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data,
> coded representations for compressed image data, and gives guidance on how to
> implement these processes in practice. Is applicable to continuous-tone -
> grayscale or colour - digital still image data and to a wide range of
> applications which require use of compressed images. Is not applicable to
> bi-level image data.
